1. 
After adding the tests that needs to be pushed from HIS -> Mirth.
e.g:CT Lt. Ankle & foot

I have enabled Medic Status privelege for `Doctors`.

I logged in as doctor and have added the test.

 When we select `Medic Send Out` yellow tag -> The color should change from yellow to grey
 with `.... Sent` status.
 
 **Previously the tag color was changing. But current context the tag color is NOT CHANGING**
 
2.
C:\Eclinic_Documents\Medic\IN folder is where the workorder is read by MIRTH.

**ONLY ORM messages are getting generated. There are NO ADT message. KNG requires ADT messafes also**
